# About:
The state of Florida places limits on the amount of medical marijuana that a patient may purchase in a given period of time.

This utility is used to quickly calculate the maximum quantity of each product that a medical marijuana patient can purchase.

Product dispensation amounts are configurable and more features are planned for the future.

Future releases and source code are available on my GitHub project page:
