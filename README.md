# About:
The state of Florida places limits on the amount of medical marijuana that a patient may purchase in a given period of time.  When packing an order, products commonly need to be removed from the order in order to remain under the limit established by the state. 

This utility is used to quickly calculate the maximum quantity of each product that a medical marijuana patient can purchase.  This allows the dispensary associate to spend less time determining what needs to be removed from the order, and calculates an outcome that is consistently accurate.

Product dispensation amounts are configurable and more features are planned for the future.

Future releases and source code are available on my GitHub project page:
